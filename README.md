# Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail (Level - Beginner)

This project uses exploratory data analysis to analyze retail data. The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook and uses libraries such as pandas, numpy, and seaborn to perform data analysis and visualization. The goal of the project is to explore the data and gain insights into sales transactions.

## Getting Started

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook to perform exploratory data analysis on retail data. The code imports necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and seaborn. It reads data from a CSV file and performs exploratory data analysis and data visualization.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Data analysis and manipulation tool
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Data visualization library based on matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy seaborn
```
